# challenge-6-weather-app
In this assignment the goal was to create a weather application using a side-server api to display the 5 day forecast of any given city searched, as well as keeping a local storage of searches as a history. After a city is searched the app will render the 5 day forecast displaying icons based on the weather in that city along with the temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The user may also click on previous searched cities that are stored to revisit previous searches to avoid retyping a city.
